        Hello there! I'm Dana Patrick, and I'm thrilled to have you here. Originally a technical recruiter by trade, I discovered my true passion for coding and software engineering along my career journey. With a strong educational background in psychology, including a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in industrial organizational psychology, I bring a unique perspective to the world of programming.

My enthusiasm for coding led me to pursue further education at TrueCoders, where I completed a rigorous coding bootcamp in software engineering. During this transformative experience, I honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies, with a particular focus on C#, .NET, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

What drives me in the realm of programming is the ability to create innovative solutions and transform ideas into tangible products. The power of technology to streamline processes and enhance user experiences fascinates me, and I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems through elegant and efficient code.

As a detail-oriented and results-driven individual, I have cultivated a strong aptitude for collaboration and communication, which allows me to work effectively in both team-based and individual projects. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest advancements in the ever-evolving field of software development.

When I'm not immersed in coding and exploring new technologies, you can find me engaging in playing video games, spending time with family and friends, or watching Udemy Videos to further my knowledge. I genuinely enjoy dedicating my free time to the development of my programming skills and learning new and unique ways to manipulate coding languages. 

I am excited to contribute my skills and passion to innovative projects that make a positive impact. If you're looking for a dedicated software engineer with expertise in C#, .NET, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, I would love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to create exceptional solutions.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
